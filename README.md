# Munch and Learn on Hamler

## Build it and run it

To make this work you need to ...

* install [hamler](https://github.com/hamler-lang/hamler)
* cd into one of the directories
* run `hamler build && hamler run` (or read the `README` for more/further instructions)

## Notes

* 01-03 build and run
* 04-06 build, but do not run
* 07 is WIP
